# Problem
Africans working abroad find it difficult to get trusted people in africa to help them set up and manage a company/business in africa which could create employment/jobs while they are away, This has forced most of them to stay back abroad because they have nothing to fall back to in africa after retirement.

Africans abroad often have problems getting trusted people to help them buy lands and build houses in africa as most of them have been duped in the past of their hard earned money and some even lost their lives as a result of battling with relatives over their hard earned money

Internet fraudsters who have duped international companies have made it hard for Africans to transact with international companies who need raw materials from africa for production which has forced most producers of the raw material to shut down businesses.
# Solution
To create a platform that employs qualified and trusted personel and then connect with africans abroad who want to build and scale their businesses in africa even while they are away thereby creating more jobs and something for returnees to come back home to after their stay abroad and apply their international expertise to develop and create more jobs in africa.

We also will help Africans abroad buy verified/approved lands and employ qualified engineers signed on our platform to help them build their structures thereby creating employment for more people in the construction industry.

A platform that partners with international companies to recruits, train and empower youths to farm raw materials needed for export which will be bought back from them for exportation thereby creating jobs for the youths involved and increasing the capacity of producers.
